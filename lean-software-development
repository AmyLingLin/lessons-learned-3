For tech startups operating on a minimal budget, lean software development is a critical concept.
Lean can essentially be boiled down to one simple idea: eliminate anything in the software development process that isn't adding value.  By focusing only on necessary aspects of the process and avoiding waste, nascent firms can be more efficient and better position themselves to bring products to the market quickly and cheaply.  

Lean can be summarized by the following principals:

1. Eliminate Waste
2. Build Quality In
3. Create Knowledge
4. Defer Commitment
5. Deliver Fast
6. Respect People
7. Optimize The Whole
