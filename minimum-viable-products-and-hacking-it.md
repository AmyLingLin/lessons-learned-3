#Minimum viable Products and Hacking It

As an entrepreneur, do everything you can cheaply, sooner, easier
Think lean - don't create or do anything if it's not necesary
Embrace idea of Minimum Viable Product - Try to make do!

There are a few different types of MVPs:
1) landing page - to test interest, see who views and signs up
2) video showcasing concept
3) email only or concierge
MVPs (without building up full code)  will help make sure there is demand, that you'll have cusotmers to buy your product
Make sure there is product to market fit - don't build something until you figure out a need and demand

Ask: what can you do quickly without labor, without capital, without engineers? 
Find ways to hack it!
The most important part of managing a start-up in the early  stages is minimizing cycle time and maximizing learning

Once you determine need, you still need to ask:
Can I do what I need with an existing third party resource or code? 
Eliminate the need for developers or designers. 
Use 3rd party resources that have built-in functionality and see if you can make do
Ex. [Shopify]: http://www.shopify.com for e-commerce or [Squarespace]: http://www.squarespace.com for websites
