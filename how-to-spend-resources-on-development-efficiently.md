<h1>Managing project resources efficiently</h1>

1.	Controlling project scope
2.	Setting the team
3.	Working with estimates
4.	Budgeting/contracting
5.	Controlling

<b>1.	Controlling project scope</b><br><p>
-	Use minimum solution approach (run the project if it’s sufficient – consider tweaking later on as long as it meets client/costumer’s needs – see more in minimum-viable-products-and-hacki…)<br>
-	Use modularity (vide Pragmatic programmer) and build increments<br>
-	Run projects that have high safety margins (so 10%  or 20% more costs won’t kill them)</p>
<br>
<b>2.	Setting the team</b>
-	Consider the cost differences in building your own team (inhouse programmers are on average twice cheaper, ultimately you will need them (as long you care about the costs – at great margin maybe you don’t want to deal with technology that much) , but in order to get up to speed contracting project out makes the most sense at the beginning. 
-	The middle option is working with one/multiple independent contractors
-	If outsourcing out – US will be more costly than your own team, but Central Europe would work for around 30$/hr (4 times cheaper) and Asia even around 10$/hr. Central Europe seems to have quality. Though the further you outsource the more problems with time difference, supervision will occur. Some people even move to the country to have more control over project

<b>3.	Working with estimates</b>
-	No estimates are free, either they are included in the bill, paid separately or consume time of your programmers. 
-	If you don’t know your contractor assuming it will take double that time is a good start
<br>
<b>4.	Budgeting/contracting</b>
-	There are two types of bids hourly and fixed
-	Fixed bids theoretically limits the risk of overrun, but in fact: they push contractor to argue over scope; incentivize abusing inadequate specifications and limit the flexibility as the project grows (specs are frozen). You end up paying high amounts for amendments, improvements, bonus work and in turn got less quality for money as per hourly bid
-	Fixed bids can still make sense for small, well scoped projects, or if you don’t have another option (budget constraint etc.)  and will need to take a risk and try to run whatever is produce
-	If you go with hourly bids, the key is to put time to supervise and guide the project, the key would be to build mutual trust
<br>
<b>5.	Controlling</b>
-	The key tricks you can implement: ask for weekly demos/progress showcase
-	Tend toward decreasing sizes of modules, especially if it is your team make sure they do better than planning poker and can work with features that can be built within 1-2 days
-	Control the size of the backlog so it’s not overwhelming. It should be as small as possible, bit still allow to provide flow of work- of you don’t have time to update frequently backlog will be longer
