Takeaways: 

1. how to understand a user's github profile (assess contributions, followers, repositories)
2. what a repository is 
3. why coders use github
4. the importance of forking 
5. how and why to merge pull requests 
6. open source codes and developer communities
7. a place to "store" code
8. it's not easy to tell (at least for us) the experience level of a coder by just looking at his/her github profile but every good developer should have one and be active on it or he/she is probably not very interested in code.
9. private vs. public repositories
